# Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles I share between my desktop and laptop.

## Scripts

### track.sh
This script takes in a file in your home folder as an argument, copies it over, then symlinks.
Used to start "tracking" a new dotfile.

### install.sh
This script takes in a dotfile in the repo, makes a copy of your old, and symlinks to the new one.
Used to "install" a tracked dotfile.
